# Overview
<p align="justify">
In recent times, the explosion of information from a variety of sources and cutting edge techniques such as Deepfake have made it increasingly important to check the credibility and reliability of the data. Large volumes of data generated from diverse information channels like social media, online news outlets, and crowd-sourcing contribute valuable knowledge; however, this comes with additional challenges to ascertain the credibility of user-generated and machine-generated information, resolving conflicts among heterogeneous data sources, identifying misinformation, rumors and bias, etc. Given diverse information about an object (e.g., a natural language claim text, an entity, structured triples and social network context) from heterogeneous and multi-modal sources, how do we identify high quality and trustworthy information and information sources? How can we leverage Knowledge Bases and external evidence sources from the Web for reasoning, explaining, and validating claims? How can we generate human-interpretable explanations for the models’ verdict How can we design robust fake information (e.g., reviews and news) detection mechanisms to withstand adversarial generation strategies, as spammers and content generators are co-evolving with the advanced detectors? &nbsp;

In order to answer these questions, this workshop encourages submissions to focus on big ideas – for resolving conflicts, fact-checking, ascertaining credibility of claims, explaining predictions from deep fake detectors, developing robust adversarial mechanisms for fake content detection, manipulation and safeguards, and making detection algorithms fair and unbiased to the involved participants – in heterogeneous and multi-modal sources of information including texts, images, videos, relational data, social networks and knowledge graphs.

# Call For Papers		

Our workshop on truth discovery and fact-checking is motivated by the need for new research, tools and techniques to advance the field with the following focus areas:
	
- Data heterogeneity, multi-modality, novel applications and data sources related to truth discovery, fact-checking, and rumor detection
- Explore tools and methods that can generate human-interpretable explanations as opposed to black box methods, as transparency and lack of explanation remain a concern for industry to readily deploy these techniques in practise
- Security and robustness of fake content detection under a known or unknown environment where spammers can learn and then commit arbitrary attack strategy to poison the data or evade the detectors

*In addition to the regular workshop, we will also host a data challenge track with two shared tasks for fake review detection in an adversarial framework and fake news detection (details will be announced soon).*

The second workshop on _Truth Discovery and Fact Checking: Making a Credible Web for Tomorrow_ will provide a forum where researchers and practitioners from academia, government and industry can share insights and identify new challenges and opportunities in resolving conflicts, fact-checking and ascertaining credibility of claims. The workshop will be held in San Diego, CA on August 23, 2020 in conjunction with the [ACM SIGKDD 2020](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/).

**In view of the recent COVID-19 outbreak, the format of the workshop (in-person, virtual, or both) will be in accordance to the SIGKDD 2020 main conference format**.

## Submission Guidelines
We invite submissions for original research papers both theory and application-oriented as well as submissions from the research track and applied data science track of the main KDD conference. We encourage the participants to submit papers on novel datasets and release them to advance the field. Papers must be submitted in PDF according to the ACM Proceedings Template <https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template> in a single-blind format (including author names and affiliations). We welcome both long papers (maximum length of 9 pages) and short papers (maximum length of 5 pages). The accepted papers will be published on the workshop’s website, and will not be considered archival for resubmission purposes. Please submit your papers at the EasyChair submission link <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=truefact2020>.

We also invite participants for TrueFact 2020 Shared Tasks. Instructions for participation and awards will be announced soon!
